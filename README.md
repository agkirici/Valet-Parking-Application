# Valet-Parking-Application
Seneca College Project

I developed the project by creating its user interface (Menu system). Then I created a mockup application that represented what the application would look like and act without doing anything (Parking app). I created a prototype of the application then coding its engine and finally adding functionality to Parking to make it fully functional.
